## Artista - A mobile application designed to showcase and celebrate the latest releases of female artists.
#### In comparison to mainstream media, Artista stands for women's empowerment and gender equality by presenting the newest content made by women only. The app provides the opportunity to discover movies, music, books and even upcoming events, to support female artists and promote their important messages.
